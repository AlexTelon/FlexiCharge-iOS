# FlexiCharge-iOS
The world is changing, but it's also hurting. As temperatures rise, the society needs to act, and act now. As electric vehicles are getting increasingly more popular, its most important aspect isn't scaling nearly as well with it. Charging, an often obnoxious process making environment friendly car owners life just a bit more inconvenient that they deserve. Because of this, <i>FlexiCharge</i> was born. <b>Because saving the world should not be a nuisance.</b>

Below is a short summary and visualization of the FlexiCharge mobile iOS application and its functionalities. More thorough information and details can be found in the <a href="/FlexiCharge_Mobile_iOS_Docs.pdf">documentation.</a>
